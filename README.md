# smart_parking_system
Smart parking system using Nuvoton NUC140 microcontroller with RFID, ultrasonic sensors, servo control, and Bluetooth mobile app integration.




## ðŸ”§ How It Works
- At the **entrance**, a **distance sensor (HC-SR04)** detects the presence of a vehicle.
- Once detected, the system waits for a valid **RFID tag** assigned to that vehicle.
- If the RFID is recognized, the **servo motor** activates to open the gate and allows the car to enter.
- At the **exit**, another **ultrasonic sensor** detects a vehicle waiting to leave.
- The gate will only open if a **payment confirmation** is received via the **Android app**.

## ðŸ“± Android App
The system includes a custom Android application built with **MIT App Inventor**.  
The app allows the user to:
- Confirm and send payment for exiting the parking lot.
- View parking status .
- Communicate with the system via **Bluetooth (HC-05)**.
ðŸ“¦ App source file  is included.
